# Assembly Interpreter for SIC/XE Architecture

This is an Assembly interpreter designed to execute programs written in the SIC/XE (Simplified Instructional Computer/Extended) architecture. The interpreter is built using Java and follows object-oriented programming principles. It provides a console application interface for interacting with assembly programs.

## Features

- **SIC/XE Architecture Support:** The interpreter supports the SIC/XE architecture, including its instruction set, addressing modes, registers, and memory layout.

- **Assembly Program Execution:** The interpreter allows you to load and execute assembly programs written in the SIC/XE architecture. It can handle both simple and complex programs with branching, looping, and various addressing modes.

- **Symbol Table and Cross-Referencing:** The interpreter maintains a symbol table during program execution. It also provides cross-referencing capabilities, allowing you to analyze and understand the relationships between different parts of the program.

  

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of the SIC/XE architecture and assembly programming concepts.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Compile the Java source files using the following command:
   ````
   javac *.java
   ```

4. Run the application using the following command:
   ````
   java AssemblyInterpreter
   ```

5. The console application will start, displaying a welcome message and a command prompt.
